# hello-world
This is the practice repository.

Hi people,
This is Shyam Chauhan. I am currently studying at Ohio University in Athens, OH, USA. My area of research is high energy physics.
We do the scattering experiment by colliding heavier nucleas together and search for the new state of matter known as Quark-Gluon Plasma.

I am currently at my fourth year at OU.
